Grammar is the foundation of effective communication in English. Understanding these essential rules will help you speak and write with confidence and clarity.

## 1. Subject-Verb Agreement

The subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number.

**Rules:**
- Singular subjects take singular verbs: *The cat runs quickly.*
- Plural subjects take plural verbs: *The cats run quickly.*
- With compound subjects joined by "and": *John and Mary are coming.*
- With "or/nor": The verb agrees with the nearest subject: *Neither the teacher nor the students were ready.*

## 2. Articles: A, An, The

### Indefinite Articles (A/An)
- Use **"a"** before consonant sounds: *a book, a university*
- Use **"an"** before vowel sounds: *an apple, an hour*

### Definite Article (The)
- Use **"the"** for specific things: *The book on the table*
- Use with superlatives: *the best student*
- Use with unique things: *the sun, the moon*

## 3. Verb Tenses - The Big Three

### Present Simple
- **Form:** Subject + base verb (+ s/es for 3rd person)
- **Use:** Regular actions, facts, habits
- **Examples:** 
  - *I work every day.*
  - *She speaks three languages.*

### Past Simple
- **Form:** Subject + verb + ed (regular) / irregular forms
- **Use:** Completed actions in the past
- **Examples:**
  - *I worked yesterday.*
  - *She went to Paris last year.*

### Present Perfect
- **Form:** Subject + have/has + past participle
- **Use:** Actions connecting past to present
- **Examples:**
  - *I have lived here for five years.*
  - *She has finished her homework.*

## 4. Prepositions of Time and Place

### Time
- **At:** Specific times (*at 3 o'clock, at midnight*)
- **On:** Days and dates (*on Monday, on December 25th*)
- **In:** Months, years, seasons (*in January, in 2024, in summer*)

### Place
- **At:** Specific locations (*at the store, at home*)
- **On:** Surfaces (*on the table, on the wall*)
- **In:** Enclosed spaces (*in the box, in the room*)

## 5. Question Formation

### Yes/No Questions
- **With "be":** *Are you ready?*
- **With other verbs:** *Do you like coffee?*
- **With modal verbs:** *Can you swim?*

### WH-Questions
- **What:** *What is your name?*
- **Where:** *Where do you live?*
- **When:** *When did you arrive?*
- **Why:** *Why are you studying English?*
- **How:** *How do you feel?*

## 6. Adjective Order

When using multiple adjectives, follow this order:
**Opinion â†’ Size â†’ Age â†’ Shape â†’ Color â†’ Origin â†’ Material â†’ Purpose**

*Example: A beautiful small old round blue Chinese wooden jewelry box*

## 7. Comparative and Superlative

### One Syllable Adjectives
- **Comparative:** Add -er (*tall â†’ taller*)
- **Superlative:** Add -est (*tall â†’ tallest*)

### Two+ Syllable Adjectives
- **Comparative:** More + adjective (*more beautiful*)
- **Superlative:** Most + adjective (*most beautiful*)

### Irregular Forms
- Good â†’ better â†’ best
- Bad â†’ worse â†’ worst
- Far â†’ farther/further â†’ farthest/furthest

## Common Grammar Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Its vs It's**
   - *Its* = possessive (*The dog wagged its tail*)
   - *It's* = it is (*It's raining today*)

2. **Your vs You're**
   - *Your* = possessive (*Your book is here*)
   - *You're* = you are (*You're very kind*)

3. **There, Their, They're**
   - *There* = place (*The book is there*)
   - *Their* = possessive (*Their car is red*)
   - *They're* = they are (*They're coming soon*)

## Practice Tips

1. **Read regularly** - Notice how grammar works in context
2. **Write daily** - Apply rules in your own sentences
3. **Speak aloud** - Practice makes perfect
4. **Use grammar exercises** - Reinforce learning
5. **Don't fear mistakes** - They're part of learning!
