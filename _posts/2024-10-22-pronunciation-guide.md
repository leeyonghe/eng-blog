## Common Korean Speaker Mistakes

### Avoid These Patterns:
- Saying "Engrish" instead of "English"
- "Bery" instead of "very"  
- "Dis" instead of "this"
- "Pree" instead of "free"
- "Rello" instead of "hello"

## Your Pronunciation Journey

Remember: Every native English speaker had to learn these sounds as a child. With consistent practice and patience, you can master them too!

**Week 1 Goal:** Master one sound pair (choose R/L or F/P)
**Week 2 Goal:** Add TH sounds to your practice
**Week 3 Goal:** Combine all sounds in sentences
**Week 4 Goal:** Use correctly in natural conversation

**Most Important:** Don't be afraid to make mistakes! Every mispronunciation is a learning opportunity. Native speakers appreciate the effort, and clear communication matters more than perfect pronunciation.
